# sh-car-valuation

This project involves predicting the listing price of a second-hand car based on several characteristics. R2 is the evaluation metric used.

The dataset has been divided into train and test sets, each attached with a JSON file. To select the model and hyperparameters, you should further split the train set. Both files contain an 'id' field, which will solely be used for entry identification, a 'price' field representing the value to be predicted, and multiple attributes. The test file has the 'price' field filled with null values.
